# Build-a-Password


## Description

Build-a-Password is site used to generate a secure password via alerts. In the age of roto-calls and phishing emails, security is very important. However, it is hard to come up with a password that is complex enough to keep you safe. Wouldn't it be nice to just have one generated for you and let your browser remember it. 

While I was developing the logic for the site, I familiarized myself with JavaScript. Building out functions, using recursion within said functions, using the prototype methods of arrays and Strings; through these concepts I was able to improve knwledge base so I can build more complex websites in the future. 

Below is an demo of the site:
